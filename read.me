In MATLAB, the Object-Oriented Programming Onramp program includes the following tasks:

Fundamental Concepts:

Understanding why and when Object-Oriented Programming is used in MATLAB.
Learning the basic concepts of classes and objects in MATLAB.
Class Creation:

Learning how to create classes in MATLAB.
Defining properties and methods of classes.
Object Instantiation:

Learning to create objects from classes.
Setting properties of objects and invoking methods.
Inheritance:

Understanding inheritance relationships between classes.
Learning to use inheritance when creating new classes.
Interfaces:

Learning how to define interfaces in MATLAB.
Understanding how to implement the same interface for multiple classes.
Error Handling:

Learning basic information about error catching and handling in MATLAB.
Example Applications:

Practicing Object-Oriented Programming concepts by developing a simple application.
These fundamental tasks reflect the general topics that a MATLAB Object-Oriented Programming Onramp program might cover. The content and sequence of specific tasks may vary depending on the design of the training program.
